Hello, I'm Brett! My research interests are applied control theory, electronics, systems and modelling, wearable technology, and biomedical engineering.

My current position is as a Scientific Assistant at ETH Zürich's [BMHT Lab](https://bmht.ethz.ch/). The group primarily works on textile sensor technologies with the goals to enable personalized health, guide rehabilitation, and improve athletic performance. Recently, we have developed a new type of [textile strain sensor](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/adma.202209321?download=true) that uses an auxetic structure to exceed the theoretical maximum sensitivity for capacitive strain sensors. 

I completed my master's degree at the University of British Columbia in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. My [thesis]({{ '/assets/pdf/thesis-masc.pdf' | relative_url }}) research was on applying control theory to improve performance and stability of sigma-delta modulators as part of the [Digital Health Innovation Lab](https://bcchr.ca/dhil) team. During this, I did a Mitacs Accelerate Fellowship to translate this research with an industry partner, [ESS Technology](https://www.esstech.com/).

I previously worked as a software developer at [Lungpacer Medical](https://lungpacer.com/), while it was still a spin-off from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, B.C., Canada. Lungpacer is an innovative medical device start-up commercializing minimally-invasive diaphragm pacing to improve weaning in mechanically ventilated patients. There I wrote software for experimental data collection and designed algorithms for the control of diaphragm stimulation. I also do some contract work, primarily in signal processing, data analysis, and software development applied to biomedical engineering.

Please enjoy some of my [project posts]({{ '/blog/' | relative_url }}), [code]({{ '/repositories/' | relative_url }}), and [publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}). I also enjoy many outdoors sports such as [skiing]({{ '/blog/tag/skiing/' | relative_url }}), [mountaineering]({{ '/blog/tag/mountains/' | relative_url }}), fishing, and [cycling]({{ '/blog/tag/bikes/' | relative_url }}). I will try to include some of these activities here as well as my other assorted [fun projects]({{ '/blog/tag/fun/' | relative_url }}). I am in the process of writing up more of these, hopefully they can be helpful!
