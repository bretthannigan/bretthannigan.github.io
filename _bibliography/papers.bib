abstract = {Structured system identification often requires solving optimization problems that are not deterministic in computation time and may converge to a local optimum. For the case of systems that can be represented as a SISO “RC- ladder” impedance network, this paper presents a closed-form algorithm that can determine the structured state-space matrices and extract the parameters from an arbitrarily transformed system, such as that produced by subspace system identification. This algorithm relies on a modified version of the Lanczos tridiagonalization process and the solving of a least squares problem with dimension equal to the system order. It is fast, deterministic, and successful for systems of low to moderate order. Practical applications include network synthesis, thermal model identification, and distributed sensing reconstruction, where exact RC parameter values must be identified from data.},

abstract = {Mobile health technology and activity tracking with wearable sensors enable continuous unobtrusive monitoring of movement and biophysical parameters. Advancements in clothing-based wearable devices have employed textiles as transmission lines, communication hubs, and various sensing modalities; this area of research is moving towards complete integration of circuitry into textile components. A current limitation for motion tracking is the need for communication protocols demanding physical connection of textile with rigid devices, or vector network analyzers (VNA) with limited portability and lower sampling rates. Inductor–capacitor (LC) circuits are ideal candidates as textile sensors can be easily implemented with textile components and allow wireless communication. In this paper, the authors report a smart garment that can sense movement and wirelessly transmit data in real time. The garment features a passive LC sensor circuit constructed of electrified textile elements that sense strain and communicate through inductive coupling. A portable, lightweight reader (fReader) is developed for achieving a faster sampling rate than a downsized VNA to track body movement, and for wirelessly reading sensor information suitable for deployment with a smartphone. The smart garment–fReader system monitors human movement in real-time and exemplifies the potential of textile-based electronics moving forward.},

abstract = {The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e. gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which improves the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. We present the employment of helical auxetic yarns, which have yet to be used as capacitive sensors, likely because there is not a straightforward correlation of how the auxetic character would impact sensor sensitivity. We complete the modeling of helical auxetic yarns to provide insight into ideal sensor variables that would enable us to fabricate sensors that can span a wide range of strains, while also possessing auxetic character. We hypothesized that possessing auxetic character would result in higher sensitivity, which did turn out to be partially correct. We found that the heli-cal auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (which we term HACS) response was dependent on the two variables of i) the ratio of diameters between the two conductive fiber elements, and ii) the initial helical lengths. Depending on these variables, we could obtain sensors that responded to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitances. We found a greater auxetic character resulted in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains-a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, we obtained the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far. We propose a mechanism-that is unique to these sensors-of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally .},

abstract = {Objective: Handheld dynamometers are common tools for assessing/monitoring muscular strength and endurance. Health/fitness Bluetooth load sensors may provide a cost-effective alternative; however, research is needed to evaluate the validity and reliability of such devices. This study assessed the validity and reliability of two commercially available Bluetooth load sensors (Activ5 by Activbody and Progressor by Tindeq). Methods: Four tests were conducted on each device: stepped loading, stress relaxation, simulated exercise, and hysteresis. Each test type was repeated three times using the Instron ElectroPuls mechanical testing device (a gold-standard system). Test–retest reliability was assessed through intraclass correlations. Agreement with the gold standard was assessed with Pearson's correlation, interclass correlation, and Lin's concordance correlation. Results: The Activ5 and Progressor had excellent test–retest reliability across all four tests (ICC(3,1) ≥ 0.999, all p ≤ 0.001). Agreement with the gold standard was excellent for both the Activ5 ($\rho$ ≥ 0.998, ICC(3,1) ≥ 0.971, $\rho$c ≥ 0.971, all p's ≤ 0.001) and Progressor ($\rho$ ≥ 0.999, ICC(3,1) ≥ 0.999, $\rho$c ≥ 0.999, all p's ≤ 0.001). Measurement error increased for both devices as applied load increased. Conclusion: Excellent test–retest reliability was found, suggesting that both devices can be used in a clinical setting to measure patient progress over time; however, the Activ5 consistently had poorer agreement with the gold standard (particularly at higher loads).},

abstract = {Fibre strain sensors commonly use three major modalities to transduce strain—piezoresistance, capacitance, and inductance. The electrical signal in response to strain differs between these sensing technologies, having varying sensitivity, maximum measurable strain rate, and susceptibility to deleterious effects like hysteresis and drift. The wide variety of sensor materials and strain tracking applications makes it difficult to choose the best sensor modality for a wearable device when considering signal quality, cost, and difficulty of manufacture. Fibre strain sensor samples employing the three sensing mechanisms are fabricated and subjected to strain using a tensile tester. Their mechanical and electrical properties are measured in response to strain profiles designed to exhibit particular shortcomings of sensor behaviour. Using these data, the sensors are compared to identify materials and sensing technologies well suited for different textile motion tracking applications. Several regression models are trained and validated on random strain pattern data, providing guidance for pairing each sensor with a model architecture that compensates for non-ideal effects. A thermoplastic elastomer-core piezoresistive sensor had the highest sensitivity (average gauge factor: 12.6) and a piezoreistive sensor of similar construction with a polyether urethane-urea core had the largest bandwidth, capable of resolving strain rates above 300{\%}/s with 36{\%} signal amplitude attenuation. However, both piezoresistve sensors suffered from larger hysteresis and drift than a coaxial polymer sensor using the capacitive strain sensing mechanism. Machine learning improved the piezoresistive sensors' root-mean-squared error when tracking a random strain signal by up to 58{\%} while maintaining their high sensitivity, bandwidth, and ease of interfacing electronically.},

abstract = {Introduction: Most running-related injuries are believed to be caused by abrupt changes in training load, compounded by biomechanical movement patterns. Wearable technology has made it possible for runners to quantify biomechanical loads (e.g., peak positive acceleration; PPA) using commercially available inertial measurement units (IMUs). However, few devices have established criterion validity. The aim of this study was to assess the validity of two commercially available IMUs during running. Secondary aims were to determine the effect of footwear, running speed, and IMU location on PPA. Materials and Methods: Healthy runners underwent a biomechanical running analysis on an instrumented treadmill. Participants ran at their preferred speed in three footwear conditions (neutral, minimalist, and maximalist), and at three speeds (preferred, +10{\%}, −10{\%}) in the neutral running shoes. Four IMUs were affixed at the distal tibia (IMeasureU-Tibia), shoelaces (RunScribe and IMeasureU-Shoe), and insole (Plantiga) of the right shoe. Pearson correlations were calculated for average vertical loading rate (AVLR) and PPA at each IMU location. Results: The AVLR had a high positive association with PPA (IMeasureU-Tibia) in the neutral and maximalist (r = 0.70–0.72; p ≤ 0.001) shoes and in all running speed conditions (r = 0.71–0.83; p ≤ 0.001), but low positive association in the minimalist (r = 0.47; p {\textless} 0.05) footwear condition. Conversely, the relationship between AVLR and PPA (Plantiga) was high in the minimalist (r = 0.75; p ≤ 0.001) condition and moderate in the neutral (r = 0.50; p {\textless} 0.05) and maximalist (r = 0.57; p {\textless} 0.01) footwear. The RunScribe metrics demonstrated low to moderate positive associations (r = 0.40–0.62; p {\textless} 0.05) with AVLR across most footwear and speed conditions. Discussion: Our findings indicate that the commercially available Plantiga IMU is comparable to a tibia-mounted IMU when acting as a surrogate for AVLR. However, these results vary between different levels of footwear and running speeds. The shoe-mounted RunScribe IMU exhibited slightly lower positive associations with AVLR. In general, the relationship with AVLR improved for the RunScribe sensor at slower speeds and improved for the Plantiga and tibia-mounted IMeasureU sensors at faster speeds.},

abstract = {The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) and its passive and active peaks are important gait parameters and of great relevance for musculoskeletal injury analysis and prevention, the detection of gait abnormities, and the evaluation of lower-extremity prostheses. Most currently available methods to estimate the vGRF require a force plate. However, in real-world scenarios, gait monitoring would not be limited to a laboratory setting. This paper reports a novel solution using machine learning algorithms to estimate the vGRF and the timing and magnitude of its peaks from data collected by a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) on one of the lower limb locations. Nine volunteers participated in this study, walking on a force plate-instrumented treadmill at various speeds. Four IMUs were worn on the foot, shank, distal thigh, and proximal thigh, respectively. A random forest model was employed to estimate the vGRF from data collected by each of the IMUs. We evaluated the performance of the models against the gold standard measurement of the vGRF generated by the treadmill. The developed model achieved a high accuracy with a correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and normalized root mean square error of 1.00, 0.02 body weight (BW), and 1.7{\%} in intra-participant testing, and 0.97, 0.10 BW, and 7.15{\%} in inter-participant testing, respectively, for the shank location. The difference between the reference and estimated passive force peak values was 0.02 BW and 0.14 BW with a delay of −0.14{\%} and 0.57{\%} of stance duration for the intra-and inter-participant testing, respectively; the difference between the reference and estimated active force peak values was 0.02 BW and 0.08 BW with a delay of 0.45{\%} and 1.66{\%} of stance duration for the intra-and inter-participant evaluation, respectively. We concluded that vertical ground reaction force can be estimated using only a single IMU via machine learning algorithms. This research sheds light on the development of a portable wearable gait monitoring system reporting the real-time vGRF in real-life scenarios.},

abstract = {The sigma delta architecture of analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is especially applicable to digitizing most bio-signals. High order single-bit sigma delta modulators provide high resolution and linearity with low circuit complexity but require careful design to avoid unstable states. Many existing methods of designing these systems have few degrees of freedom, rely extensively on simulations, and do not provide guarantees about stability. The problem of designing sigma delta modulators with high performance and a clear indicator of the performance versus stability is addressed in this dissertation. This is done by developing a model of the sigma delta modulator that more accurately represents the system including robustness against the nonlinearities due to the quantizer element. After introducing many stability criteria from literature, those most suited to design are identified and the model adjusted to allow these criteria to be applied. High performance is maintained by using the generalized Kalman-Yakubovic-Popov (GKYP) lemma to maximize noise rejection in the signal band using a semidefinite programming (SDP) framework that also permits the use of H∞, H2, and l1 norm-based stability constraints on the system. Several designs using this framework are presented and their relative merits discussed. Examples include an aggressive noise shaping design to compete with existing methods on the basis of performance and designs with guaranteed stability for a range of input signals. The performance-stability trade-off for the different stability constraints using this work is examined and motivated by simulation results.},

It has been hypothesized that electrically pacing the diaphragm during mechanical ventilation could reduce diaphragm dysfunction. Objectives We tested a novel, central line catheter-based, transvenous phrenic nerve pacing therapy for protecting the diaphragm in sedated and ventilated pigs. Methods Eighteen Yorkshire pigs were studied. Six pigs were sedated and mechanically ventilated for 2.5 days with pacing on alternate breaths at intensities that reduced the ventilator pressure-time-product by 20{\%}-30{\%}. Six matched subjects were similarly sedated and ventilated, but were not paced. Six pigs served as never-ventilated, never- paced controls. Measurements and Main Results Cumulative duration of pacing therapy ranged from 19.7 to 35.7 hours. Diaphragm thickness assessed by ultrasound and normalized to initial value showed a significant decline in ventilated-not paced but not in ventilated-paced subjects (0.84, interquartile range (IQR)=0.78-0.89 vs. 1.10, IQR=1.02-1.24; P=0.001).
